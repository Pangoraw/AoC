# AoC

Repository for the Advent of Code 2020 in Python :snake:.

## Usage

The repository handles the download of input files automatically and caches them in the `inputs` folder to prevent server spam. The file [`day00.py`](https://github.com/Pangoraw/AoC/blob/main/days/day00.py) is used as a template for everyday. The `aoc` folder contains functions useful in common situations.

Every day, run the following command to bootstrap the file and download the corresponding input.

```
./new_day.sh
```
